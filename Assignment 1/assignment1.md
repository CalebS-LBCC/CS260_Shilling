Assignment 1 must simulate a bag of marbles using simple code.

The input marbles must have a color applied to them. This will either be Red,
Green, or Blue. Stored data will be a character holding either R, B, or G, to
represent the colors.
The program needs the ability to place a marble in the bag and pull a random
marble out of the bag.
To perform these functions, a custom stack class will be written with the
following functions:
Able to add a single marble of a color to the stack
Able to add many marbles of a color to the stack
Able to pull a random marble off the stack
Marbles will be represented by a char list inside of the stack.

Assignment 1 must also undergo basic testing.

The following tests will be ran on Assigment 1:
Place in a marble and take it out, and ensure it is the same marble
Place in 5 marbles and take all 5 out, and ensure the 5 marbles are the same
Ensure that attempting to take a marble out of an empty bag is denied by the program
Ensure the program runs properly when placing in a large number of marbles
